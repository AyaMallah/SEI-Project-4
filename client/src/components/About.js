          <h4>Hey there, green thumb...</h4>
          <p>
            A few years ago I started adding greenery to my environment. I knew that the benefits of indoor plants were numerous, but maintenance was the recurring issue. So I decided to research and found affordable and asthetically pleasing ways to look after my plants.

            This blog is about the basics of plant parenthood. I want to help you enjoy healthy, thriving plants.
            A green thumb isnâ€™t about luck but about being observant.
