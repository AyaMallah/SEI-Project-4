    "description": "The Pothos plant is often considered to be a great starter house plant because they are easy to care for and survive in most conditions.  They grow well in bright light and in low light although itâ€™s best to avoid too much direct sunlight.  When it comes to watering, pothos like to dry out in between each watering.",

    "description": "I am so happy with my new set! Succulent plants have a unique adaptation that enables them to tolerate limited watering better than most houseplants. Their thick, fleshy leaves and stems, as well as their enlarged roots, allow them to retain water so that they do not need watering as frequently as other plants.",

It is a green leaf with red on it (kind of marbled) and the stem has fine red vains. It is no longer standing up right either. I have no idea what it is or how to save it. All advice greatly appreciated. Thank you",

But there is still a chance to save it! Use a fork to break up the dry soil, then submerge the entire container in a bucket of lukewarm water. Remove the pot from the bucket and allow the plant to drain thoroughly, then use scissors to prune the plant down.",
